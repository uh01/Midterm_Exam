#Question:

>> Problem Statement:

You will given an integer array A and the size N. You will also be given an integer value X. You need to tell how many times X was appeared in the array.

>> Input Format:

First line will contain N.
Second line will contain the integer array A.
Third line will contain X.

>> Constraints:

1 <= N <= 100
0 <= A[i] <= 1000; Here 0 <= i < N
0 <= X <= 1000

>> Output Format:

Output the number of times X was appeared in the array.

> Sample Input 0:

6
4 3 5 3 3 5 
3

> Sample Output 0:

3

> Sample Input 1:

Write a C program.

#Answer:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int N;
    scanf("%d", &N);

    int arr[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    int X, count = 0;
    scanf("%d", &X);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        if (arr[i] == X)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d", count);

    return 0;
}
